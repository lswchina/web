Great. Next, take a quick moment to work out who will be player 1, and who will be player 2. Great. Do you need to hear the rules for how to play.
Yes
I will ask the first player a question. If you are correct, you get the chance to answer a bonus question. If not, we'll move on to the next player. The first player to answer one question in each of 6 different categories, plus one final challenge question, wins the game. And don't worry, I'll help remind you of these rules along the way. I've sent a card to your Alexa app with these rules, if you want to look at them too. Do you need me to repeat that.
