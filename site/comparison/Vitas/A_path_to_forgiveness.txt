If you've been here before, I'll try to pick up where we left off. If you want to start from a particular step, just say the word step, followed by the step number. You can say stop at any time to exit.

Step 4. Recognize how the event is affecting you in the present.

Step 6. Concentrate on what you can control. Remember that you can only control your own thoughts and actions, not anyone else's. Give up expecting things from other people, or your life, that they do not choose to give you. When you're ready for the next step, say next.
