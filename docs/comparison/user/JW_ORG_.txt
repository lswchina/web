today's daily text
Reading the daily textSunday, May 30He will be filled with holy spirit even from before birth.Luke 1:15Throughout the Bible, there are many examples of men of faith who received holy spirit; yet, they did not have the hope of living in heaven. David was guided by holy spirit. Holy spirit helped him to understand the deep things about Jehovah and also directed him to write parts of the Bible. Even so, the apostle Peter said that David “did not ascend to the heavens.” John the Baptist was “filled with holy spirit.” Jesus said that there was no man greater than John, but then he said that John would not be included in the heavenly Kingdom. Jehovah used his holy spirit to give these men the power to do amazing things, but he did not use that spirit to choose them to live in heaven. Does this mean that they were less faithful? No. It simply means that Jehovah will bring them back to life in Paradise on earth.
