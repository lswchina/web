<Short audio>..<Short audio>..<Short audio>.Welcome to the Treasure Words game. Think of a nice threeletter word, without repeating letters, and I'll guess it by asking you test words. Score my words, by telling me how many gold and silver letters I got. Gold letters are the same as in your word and at exactly the same place. Silver letters are the ones that are shared, but at different positions. You can always say, help, if you need a reminder of how it works. It'll be much easier to play, if you write down your word on a piece of paper.<Short audio>.Are you ready.
