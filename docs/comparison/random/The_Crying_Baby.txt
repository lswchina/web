Help
This game is pretty simple, you ask the crying baby for the type of cry you want to hear, and she performs it for you. At the moment, you can ask her for a normal, tired, angry, bored, I want a cuddle, sleepy, starving, wait for it, grumpy,  or mega tantrum cry. Otherwise, you can ask baby for a random cry, and she'll choose any that you haven't listened to yet. Now, just ask baby for a cry and enjoy.
I want a cuddle
<Short audio>.That was a good one, wasn't it.  This time, why don't you ask for a bored cry. If you can't decide, just request a random cry. You won't be disappointed.
starving
<Short audio>.The crying baby sure knows how to put on a show.  For the next one, may I recommend the bored cry. Otherwise, just ask for a random cry.
Stop
The crying baby really doesn't want you to leave...<Short audio>.She hopes to see you soon.

Quick. The Crying baby is growing impatient... If that helps, some of my personal favorites are the  bored,  angry,  or  normal  cry. Can't decide. Simply ask for a random cry. If baby is struggling to understand you, just say 'do a...', before the type of cry you wish to hear.
