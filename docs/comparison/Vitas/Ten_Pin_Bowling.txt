The object of the game is to play a game of ten pin bowling and try and knock down as many pins as you can in ten frames. Play with one player or up to four. If you have Echo Buttons, watch them light up and press them to roll the ball. The premium version of the skill allows you to compete in a bowling league. Say, What can I buy, for more details.
