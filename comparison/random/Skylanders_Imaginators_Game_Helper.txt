Here is Skylander Master Chain Reaction. Its catch phrase is The Saw is a Law.. Element of type Tech. Battle Class is Swashbuckler. No matter what he was doing, Chain Reaction always prided himself at being the best at it. Despite his impressive skills, though, the two chainsaw swords he regularly wielded tended to scare most people away. As a result, Chain Reaction was often lonely. But that all changed the day he witnessed a group of young dwarves getting picked on by an evil gang of ninja rats. After fighting off the rats, the dwarves looked at Chain Reaction as their hero, and followed him everywhere he went. While Chain Reaction appreciated the company, he knew that he could not protect them forever, so he decided to teach them all he knew so that they could one day protect themselves..

Here is Skylander Golden Queen. Its catch phrase is I Reign Supreme.. Element of type Earth. Battle Class is Sorcerer  . A powerful sorceress made entirely of gold and riches beyond your wildest imagination. She'd trade her entire fortune for just a little more. But why trade when you can steal. So that's what she did. She stole, and stole, and stole. No matter how much she took though, it was never enough. Through evil sorcery, she even learned how to turn people and objects into solid gold. Yet STILL, that just wasn't enough. The idea that there was any amount of treasure out in Skylands that didn't belong to her was infuriating, so she set out on a quest to take every last cent of it. But she couldn't do it alone.. See your Alexa app for more info.  Would you like to hear about another Skylander.

Here is Skylander Dr. Krancase. Its catch phrase is The Docter is In.. Element of type Tech. Battle Class is Quickshot. No one is really quite sure what exactly Dr. Krankcase is a doctor of.
