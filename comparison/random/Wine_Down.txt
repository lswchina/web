details
The host will send a calendar invite at least two weeks before the event with a recap of the last episode, the big announcement of the rule of the next meet and ideally a joke. The day of, the host will set a long table with some fun decorations, full dinner set and of course, two wine glasses on each seat for whites and reds. When all your foodie friends have arrived, they will announce what they brought and a lineup will be set to progress from appetizers to dessert. They will now present their dishes and wine one at a time. Oven should stay warm and contestants can put their dishes in at any time to be prepared for their turn. They are welcome to use the microwave or the fridge as well. For each participant, no food can be tasted until everyone has both food and wine, at which point everyone should cheer. After all dishes have been tasted, foodies will vote on their favorite wine, food and paring. Pairing will take the trophy home and should be voted for first, second and third place in that category getting four, two and one points respectively. Winner of the pairing category gets to come without bringing anything next time and gets to set a rule for the next meet. Now go schedule your next winedown.. Whahoo.
