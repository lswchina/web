tell me about home fires
Home Fires. In just two minutes, a fire can become life-threatening. In five minutes, a residence can be engulfed in flames. Fire is FAST! In less than 30 seconds a small flame can turn into a major fire. It only takes minutes for thick black smoke to fill a house or for it to be engulfed in flames. Fire is HOT! Heat is more threatening than flames. Room temperatures in a fire can be 100 degrees at floor level and rise to 600 degrees at eye level. Inhaling this super-hot air will scorch your lungs and melt clothes to your skin. Fire is DARK! Fire starts bright, but quickly produces black smoke and complete darkness. Fire is DEADLY! Smoke and toxic gases kill more people than flames do. Fire produces poisonous gases that make you disoriented and drowsy. Asphyxiation is the leading cause of fire deaths, exceeding burns by a three-to-one ratio. If you would like to learn more what to do before, during or after this type of event, just ask me things like "How do I prepare for Home Fires" or "What do I do during Home Fires".
how do i prepare for home fires
Home Fires. Create and Practice a Fire Escape Plan In the event of a fire, remember that every second counts, so you and your family must always be prepared. Escape plans help you get out of your home quickly. Twice each year, practice your home fire escape plan. Some tips to consider when preparing this plan include: Find two ways to get out of each room in the event the primary way is blocked by fire or smoke. A secondary route might be a window onto a neighboring roof or a collapsible ladder for escape from upper story windows. Make sure that windows are not stuck, screens can be taken out quickly, and that security bars can be properly opened. Practice feeling your way out of the house in the dark or with your eyes closed. Teach children not to hide from firefighters. Smoke Alarms. A working smoke alarm significantly increases your chances of surviving a deadly home fire. Install both ionization AND photoelectric smoke alarms, OR dual sensor smoke alarms, which contain both ionization and photoelectric smoke sensors. Test batteries monthly. Replace batteries in battery-powered and hard-wired smoke alarms at least once a year (except non-replaceable 10-year lithium batteries). Install smoke alarms on every level of your home, including the basement, both inside and outside of sleeping areas. Replace the entire smoke alarm unit every 8-10 years or according to manufacturer's instructions. Never disable a smoke alarm while cooking - it can be a deadly mistake. Smoke Alarm Safety for People with Access or Functional Needs Audible alarms for visually impaired people should pause with a small window of silence between each successive cycle so that they can listen to instructions or voices of others. Smoke alarms with a vibrating pad or flashing light are available for the hearing impaired. Contact your local fire department for information about obtaining a flashing or vibrating smoke alarm. Smoke alarms with a strobe light outside the home to catch the attention of neighbors, and emergency call systems for summoning help, are also available. More Fire Safety Tips. Make digital copies of valuable documents and records like birth certificates. Sleep with your door closed. Contact your local fire department for information on training on the proper use and maintenance of fire extinguishers. Consider installing an automatic fire sprinkler system in your residence.

what do i do during home fires
Home Fires. Crawl low under any smoke to your exit - heavy smoke and poisonous gases collect first along the ceiling. Before opening a door, feel the doorknob and door. If either is hot, or if there is smoke coming around the door, leave the door closed and use your second way out. If you open a door, open it slowly. Be ready to shut it quickly if heavy smoke or fire is present. If you can't get to someone needing assistance, leave the home and call 9-1-1 or the fire department. Tell the emergency operator where the person is located. If pets are trapped inside your home, tell firefighters right away. If you can't get out, close the door and cover vents and cracks around doors with cloth or tape to keep smoke out. Call 9-1-1 or your fire department. Say where you are and signal for help at the window with a light-colored cloth or a flashlight. If your clothes catch fire, stop, drop, and roll - stop immediately, drop to the ground, and cover your face with your hands. Roll over and over or back and forth until the fire is out. If you or someone else cannot stop, drop, and roll, smother the flames with a blanket or towel. Use cool water to treat the burn immediately for 3 to 5 minutes. Cover with a clean, dry cloth. Get medical help right away by calling 9-1-1 or the fire department.

what do i do after home fires
Home Fires. The following checklist serves as a quick reference and guide for you to follow after a fire strikes. Contact your local disaster relief service, such as The Red Cross, if you need temporary housing, food and medicines. If you are insured, contact your insurance company for detailed instructions on protecting the property, conducting inventory and contacting fire damage restoration companies. If you are not insured, try contacting private organizations for aid and assistance. Check with the fire department to make sure your residence is safe to enter. Be watchful of any structural damage caused by the fire. The fire department should see that utilities are either safe to use or are disconnected before they leave the site. DO NOT attempt to reconnect utilities yourself. Conduct an inventory of damaged property and items. Do not throw away any damaged goods until after an inventory is made. Try to locate valuable documents and records. Refer to information on contacts and the replacement process inside this brochure. Begin saving receipts for any money you spend related to fire loss. The receipts may be needed later by the insurance company and for verifying losses claimed on income tax. Notify your mortgage company of the fire.

how do i get ready for tornadoes
Tornadoes. Know your area's tornado risk. In the U.S., the Midwest and the Southeast have a greater risk for tornadoes. Know the signs of a tornado, including a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud; an approaching cloud of debris; or a loud roar - similar to a freight train. Sign up for your community's warning system. The Emergency Alert System (E.A.S.) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (N.O.A.A.) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts. If your community has sirens, then become familiar with the warning tone. Pay attention to weather reports. Meteorologists can predict when conditions might be right for a tornado. Identify and practice going to a safe shelter in the event of high winds, such as a safe room built using FEMA criteria or a storm shelter built to ICC 500 standards. The next best protection is a small, interior, windowless room on the lowest level of a sturdy building. Consider constructing your own safe room that meets FEMA or ICC 500 standards. If you would like to learn more what to do during or after this type of event, just ask me "What do I do during Tornadoes" or "What do I do after Tornadoes"
what do i do during tornadoes
Tornadoes. Immediately go to a safe location that you identified. Take additional cover by shielding your head and neck with your arms and putting materials such as furniture and blankets around you. Listen to E.A.S., N.O.A.A. Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions. Do not try to outrun a tornado in a vehicle. If you are in a car or outdoors and cannot get to a building, cover your head and neck with your arms and cover your body with a coat or blanket, if possible. If you would like to learn more what to do before or after this type of event, just ask me "How do I prepare for Tornadoes" or "What do I do after Tornadoes"
what do i do after tornadoes
Tornadoes. Keep listening to E.A.S., N.O.A.A. Weather Radio, and local authorities for updated information. If you are trapped, cover your mouth with a cloth or mask to avoid breathing dust. Try to send a text, bang on a pipe or wall, or use a whistle instead of shouting. Stay clear of fallen power lines or broken utility lines. Do not enter damaged buildings until you are told that they are safe. Save your phone calls for emergencies. Phone systems are often down or busy after a disaster. Use text messaging or social media to communicate with family and friends. Be careful during clean-up. Wear thick-soled shoes, long pants, and work gloves.

what do i do during floods
Floods. Depending on where you are, and the impact and the warning time of flooding, go to the safe location that you previously identified. If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas. Listen to E.A.S., N.O.A.A. Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions. Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don't Drown! Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning. If your vehicle is trapped in rapidly moving water, then stay inside. If water is rising inside the vehicle, then seek refuge on the roof. If trapped in a building, then go to its highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising floodwater. Go on the roof only if necessary. Once there, signal for help. If you would like to learn more what to do before or after this type of event, just ask me "How do I prepare for Floods" or "What do I do after Floods"
how do i prepare for floods
Floods. Know types of flood risk in your area. Visit FEMA's Flood Map Service Center for information. Sign up for your community's warning system. The Emergency Alert System (E.A.S.) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (N.O.A.A.) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts. If flash flooding is a risk in your location, then monitor potential signs, such as heavy rain. Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response. Gather supplies in case you have to leave immediately, or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each person's specific needs, including medication. Don't forget the needs of pets. Obtain extra batteries and charging devices for phones and other critical equipment. Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect and can protect the life you've built. Homeowner's policies do not cover flooding. Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies. Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves. Consider a sump pump with a battery.

what do i do after floods
Floods. Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe. Avoid driving, except in emergencies. Snakes and other animals may be in your house. Wear heavy gloves and boots during clean up. Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock. Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris and be contaminated. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water. Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.
