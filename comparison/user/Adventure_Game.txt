Ok, Here's Adventure GameWelcome to your first Adventure! Your dragon adventure will start now. .<Short audio>You are on the top of a cliff looking over a dense forest.

yes

Clockwise it spells. N. E. S. W. You take out your compass and you see that these letters correspond with North, East, South and West. The four sides have four markings. On the north there is a castle. To the east there is a cave. To the west there is a treasure chest. On the south there is a lake. On the bottom of the cubed stone is a fierce image of a dragon that is spewing fire, but the bottom contains no directions.

There are some bright deep white scratches on some stones. One tower however is still standing as if it was created yesterday. You walk up to the tower and decide to go inside.<Short audio>You follow the stone stairs upstairs and you find a room. Inside the room are three items. A sword. A magic orb.
