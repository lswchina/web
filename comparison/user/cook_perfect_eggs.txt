fried
Okay, let's fry some eggs. First choose an appropriately sized pan for the number of eggs you are cooking. Place the pan over a medium heat. Line the bottom of the pan with oil. try to cover all the base so the egg doesn't stick and create a mess. Gently crack the egg into the hot pan. try not to drop the egg from a high distance as it can cause the oil to splash and the egg yolk may break. If the pan is hot enough you should see a bubbling action happening with the white of the egg. If you want your fried eggs sunny side up you can cover the pan part way through the cook so that the top of the egg is cooked quicker and the bottom of the egg does not burn. If you would prefer your fried eggs over easy you can flip your egg with a spatula once the bottom of the egg is cooked enough to hold the whole egg together. This is to ensure there is no mess when flipping the egg. Once both sides of the egg is cooked to your liking your fried eggs are ready. Try placing a fried egg on some buttered toast with slices of fresh tomato and pepper. Bon apetite.

poached
Alright then. In order to perfectly poach eggs you will need to prepare a few things. Firstly fill a pot with water and combine a tablespoon of white vinegar. bring the mixture to a rolling boil. While you are waiting for the water to boil, crack open one egg into a ramekin or small bowl. Once the water is rolling, slowly reduce the heat until the water is barely simmering. This is to reduce the chances of the egg mixing with the water and creating a mess. Then submerge the ramekin into the hot water and gently slide the egg into the water vinegar combination. Leave the eggs to slowly poach in the hot water until they are cooked to your liking. You can use a slotted spoon to bring the eggs up to test the firmness of the egg. Simply gently prod the egg with your finger. The white should be firm. If you like runny poached eggs the egg should be soft and bouncy when prodded. If you like hard boiled poached eggs, it should be firm to the touch. When it is cooked to your liking, simply place the eggs on a plate lined with a couple of layers of kitchen towelette to absorb any excess water. Now your poached eggs are ready for serving. My favourite way of eating poached eggs is with smashed avocado on toast. Bon apetite.

scrambled
You may think to yourself, why do I need Alexa to tell me how to scramble eggs. It's easy throw some eggs in a bowl, mix and cook in a pan. Simple right? Well there are a few tricks to this deceptively simple dish that means the difference between scrambled eggs that are moist and creamy or scrambled eggs that are dense and rubbery. Firstly combine four eggs, two tablespoons of heavy cream, and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. Be sure to gently mix the ingredients with a fork so the whites and yolk have just combined. Ensure not to over whisk the mixture so that bubbles and a foam forms on top. coat the base of a non stick frypan with a melted knob of butter over a low medium heat. You know the pan will be ready when the butter begins to sizzle. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and let it settle in its own way. Try not to disturb the mixture yet. When the bottom layer of the mixture turns from translucent to opaque the mixture is ready to be gently stirred with a rubber spatula. Try to gently bring the bottom layer to the top so that the uncooked top layer runs underneath the cooked parts. When the uncooked parts just begin to look opaque and ready remove from the heat and dish the egg out of the pan. Even if the mixture doesn't look ready, it will continue to cook with the residual heat. And there you have it. Perfectly cooked scambled eggs. Try dressing it with some finely chopped chives and salt and pepper. Bon apetite.

boiled
Fantastic. Let's get started. First things first. Place eggs straight from the fridge into an empty pot. Then fill the pot with cold water so that the eggs are covered by one inch or two and a half centimeters of water. Next, place the pot over a high heat to boil. Once the pot is at a rolling boil with streams of bubbles coming from the bottom remove from the heat and cover with a lid. When you have removed the pot from the heat please tell me how you like your boiled eggs and I can tell you how long to set your timer. Do you like soft boiled with a runny yolk , medium boiled with a half set and half runny yolk , or hard boiled with a fully set yolk.
soft boiled
great. Start a timer for four minutes. Once the timer has reached four minutes quickly take the eggs out of the hot water and place them in a bowl of cold water to stop them from cooking. Now enjoy your soft boiled eggs as you like. I would recommend gently breaking the top off the egg and dipping some toast soldiers into the yolk. Bon apetite
