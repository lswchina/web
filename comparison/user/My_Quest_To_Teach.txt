These are shared with the young adults that will be our future leaders, innovators, thought leaders and influencers of the world. A. Aspire to be part of something bigger than you are. B. Be Bold in what you do. Be on time or early for meetings. Do not subscribe to CPT (Colored People Time) when attending events and activities. C. Always be caring to people. Don't look at a persons skin color, eye color, eye shape, hairstyle, or socio-economic status. We all have a story to tell. Caring builds the world up, hating tears it down. D. Don't give into being "dared" to do anything. If there are somethings you will not do, don't let other entice or threaten you to do things that can hurt your reputation, psychology, emotional status and future life circumstances. E. Be energetic even when you do not want to or feel like it. You never know who could be watching you and have a blessing for you based on your attitude and behavior. F.

If you want to be an attorney, network with attorneys, if you want to be an educator, network with educators. G. Get up and go! Be on time even when you do not feel like it. There may be opportunties waiting for you that you could not do on your own. H. Say Hi to people, smile and when possible shake hands.

If your joyful and your spirit is joyful it will take you further in your life. Small acts of kindness last a long way. J. Keep it real in relationships, and be authentically you. Don't play mind or emotional games, people will carry that hurt with them to the grave. K. Love life and living even when it hurts. You have one life to live, love life during the hurt times and the happy times. L. Mentor others, share your knowledge, passion and purpose with others. You may be planting a seed for the next Nobel Peace Prize winner or talented author, doctor, President, etc. M. Never give up on your dreams. People will try to make you feel bad about your dreams, your hopes and your desires. Your family may want you to stop dreaming, but never do that. N. Opportunties come in challenging times. Look at things as an out of the box thinker. O. Praise God Every Day ! P. Quit complaining, use challenges to help you blossom and grow. Diamonds and precious gems only get better under pressure. Q.

As you climb remember to try and bless others on the way. R. Success is not always money; your success can be your life style, your family, achieving your goals and dreams. S. You do not have to tell everyone your dreams, sometimes it is better to keep your mouth shut. T. Technology does not build relationship, spending time, sharing conversations, breaking bread and even worshipping together builds strong and lasting relationships. U. Understand your great potential for success even if you fail at first keep pushing forward. Learn from your mistakes, dust yourself off and move forward and even if you fail "fall forward" Denzel Washington. Fall Forward https://youtu.be/6cgxSL926N8?t=3 V. Visit libraries, museums and other cultural places to learn about yours and other culture. The media will not share the truth about your race, your color, your gender, your generation. You should be a global learner and share your voice. W. Your will is powerful, your words have power, your spirit in you is unstoppable. X. What do you bring to the table, if there seems to be no room at the table bring your own chair and be willing to learn in the process of making your place at the table. Y. Your faith will take you farther than your personal strength. Never rely just on you, your faith will carry you through the hard times, it will lift you over the dangerous times and have you appreciate the peaceful times. Z. Do you have the guts to fail, do you have to nerve to push forward even if you do not see the road. Even if you travel alone have the faith to go and grow where no one else has gone.
