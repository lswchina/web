Help
Your device will listen after each prompt for eight seconds for another guess or question. If you need more time to think, feel free to take your time, and then ask your device, Alexa, ask murder mystery, followed by your new guess. To get the rules, ask, what are the rules. To get the current suspects, ask, who are the suspects. To get the weapon list, ask, what are the weapons. To get the possible rooms, ask, what are the rooms. To guess the murder, say I think blank is the killer with the blank in the blank. Every scenario is random, and can be solved with a truth table. There is no rhyme or reason to how the murderer is selected. You can now make a guess if the game has started, or can ask another question.
