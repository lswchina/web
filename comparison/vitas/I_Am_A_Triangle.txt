This blog post is titled Things Left Behind.  One way that I approached my move to Panama to make it less scary was to tell myself that I could keep a lot of things about my life in Denver the same. I could keep in touch with friends, see people when I come to town   I'd have a new life in Panama but make the effort to keep one foot in Denver. I thought I was doing a pretty good job of it. Of course, it takes two people to keep a relationship so the friendships that have survived are with the people who will make the effort with me.  I flew to Denver a week before Christmas and planned to go up to Breckenridge to meet my family to ski for a week. I am a good skier. When I lived in Denver I always had a season pass. I would count my days on the mountain and vertical feet skied. I wasn't on the leaderboard but it was something I did anyway. I love the feeling of flying down the mountain and weaving in and out of other skiers.  I had a rude awakening coming back this time around. For the first time in two years of coming back from Panama to visit I could feel the altitude affecting me. I was breathing heavily walking through the Denver airport. Huh. That's unusual. I woke up the next day with a headache. A headache that persisted for the rest of the week I was there.  Denver's altitude is 5,280 ft above sea level and Breckenridge is 9,600' at the base of the ski resort. I went to an IV bar can't believe this is a thing before heading up to the mountains. I felt great the first night in Breck but the next morning I woke up in a world of hurt. Altitude sickness feels like the worst hangover you've ever had but it doesn't get gradually better over the course of the day as a hangover would. You know that the best thing you can do is drink water, but you're so nauseous that you can't eat or drink anything. I laid on the couch willing myself to at least go to the oxygen bar yep that Google said was 450' away from my location.  I went to Breck several days earlier than my family in hopes of working on my book proposal and getting in some solo ski time. Instead, I wallowed in misery trying to hydrate and acclimate to the altitude. I was gradually getting better but once we started skiing I could feel the effects again. Not to mention that over the last two years my body has adjusted to the damp, hot climate of a Caribbean island so the dry cold on the mountain went right through me. I did less vertical feet in all thee days combined that I would normally do in one day when I lived here.  Would you like to continue with the next section titled Things Left Behind part 2.

Hi, I'm Naomi.   I was born to a white mother and a black father ... in the years when it still wasn't quite okay to be biracial.  I was homeschooled ... in the years when it wasn't quite legal to do so. I left home at the age of 16 some may say it was because of my parents' divorce or you might just reckon it was because I was headstrong and stubborn and got pregnant with my first child a year later, and found myself a young mom at the age of 18. From as early as I can remember, I've been on a quest to find and create community, and to find likeminded people who can share in my experiences. That quest continued when we moved our family overseas to New Delhi and Singapore, and it continues even now, after repatriating back to the United States.

Are you raising, or do you know anyone raising a child who is gender expansive. Parenting a child with gender expansive behavior is a marvelous, and often complicated, journey. Our world remains a very gendered place where it is clearly understood what behaviors and interests are expected for girls and how those expectations differ for boys. Just take a walk through any toy aisle, or clothing store. Clothes and toys are sorted strictly by pink and blue boys' toys are blue and red and rough and tumble. Girls' toys are pink, purple and pretty. Boys build and bury things, girls take care of dolls or cook in play kitchens. I would argue that strict gender rules are limiting for all of us, but there is a group of children for whom these rigid rules are actively harmful.  To continue this discussion, some definitions are important. We used to think that gender was based solely on the two categories boy or girl based on exterior genitals. Ultrasounds would give clear clues, and then gender was thought to be done the minute the doctor announced it officially in delivery rooms. Sex assigned at birth  is the phrase we use now to refer to those boy or girl categories assigned based on genitals.  We now understand that gender is much more complicated than two finite categories. Different from sex assigned at birth, our  gender identity  is our internal headandheart felt sense of gender. Others cannot determine this at a glance. For some, their gender identity can change over a their life time, and for others, their gender identity remains stable throughout their lifespan. For some people called cisgender their gender identity is in alignment with their sex assigned at birth. For others, called nonbinary or transgender their internal felt sense of gender is not in alignment with the sex they were assigned at birth.  Another important concept in understanding gender, is the idea that our  gender expression  how we show our internal felt sense of gender to the world is different from our gender identity. Gender expression refers to things like how we dress, or wear our hair, or the interests we choose. Some exploration with gender expression is common during childhood. Many of us have stories of sons asking for their toenails painted, or daughters playing with Tonka trucks. This type of exploration is exactly why there are dress up clothes in preschool classrooms. Our gender expression can change from day to day, but gender identity is more stable.  Finally our  sexually orientation  refers to whom we find romantically and sexually attractive. It has nothing to do with how male or female or both or neither we feel, and it is entirely separate from our gender identity.  By the time children are in preschool, other children and adults notice if the clothes and toys they choose are unexpected based on their sex assigned at birth. It is often expansive gender expression that comes to adult attention first. And in many cases, those around gender expansive children let them know quickly that what they are doing is breaking societal andor family norms. This type of negative peer and adult feedback often happens swiftly, and starts as early as preschool.  It is important to note that not all children who demonstrate gender expansive behaviors ultimate identify as nonbinary or transgender. Sometimes gender expansive children grow up to be cisgender and heterosexual. Others ultimately identify as cisgender and gay or lesbian. And others identify as nonbinary or transgender. From a parenting point of view, it is critical to have accurate information, and an ability to deal with ambiguity and follow your child's lead.
